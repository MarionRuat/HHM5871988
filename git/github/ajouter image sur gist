How to add an image to a gist

    Create or find a gist that you own.

    Clone your gist (replace <hash> with your gist's hash):

    # with ssh
    git clone git@gist.github.com:<hash>.git mygist

    # with https
    git clone https://gist.github.com/<hash>.git mygist

    Change to your gistâ€™s directory:

    cd mygist

    Add and commit the image:

    git add tulip.jpg
    git commit -m "Add tulip to gist"

    Update remote:

    git push origin master
